Follow the steps for installing a plugin as they are described at http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/

It may be beneficial to create a tar.gz of this plugin and use the web tool for installing it.  
Otherwise, you will need to insert the correct reference into the versions and plugin_settings tables.

It requires the latest version of OJS in order to function, and preferably a reasonably recent version
of PHP.
